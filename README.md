# Projects Overview

* Ant Colony Algorithm: A simulation of the ant colony behavior to solve optimization problems.
* Ant Colony Optimization: Implementation of the ACO algorithm to find optimal paths and solutions.
* Cloudy or Clear Sky Detection: A machine learning model to classify images as cloudy or clear sky.
* Color Filters: Application of various color filters on images to enhance or modify their appearance.
* Extended Erosion Model: An advanced erosion model applied to images for texture analysis.
* Fuzzy Scoring System: A system using fuzzy logic for scoring and decision-making processes.
* Identifying Apples and Oranges: A classifier to distinguish between apples and oranges in images.
* Identifying the Number and Color of Apples: A model to count apples and determine their color.
* Image Masking: Techniques to apply masks on images for segmentation and highlighting specific areas. 

# Installation and Setup
To run these projects, you need to install the required dependencies. Follow the instructions below to set up your environment:

# Prerequisites
* Python 3.x
* pip (Python package installer)

# Install OpenCV and TensorFlow
